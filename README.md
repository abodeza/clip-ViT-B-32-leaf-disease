# Fine-tuning CLIP on Classifying Plant Diseases
A jupyter notebook based project showcasing the fine-tuning process of CLIP on plant diseases image-disease name pairs.

Under the hood, this is a sentence-transformers model finetuned from sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32. It maps sentences & paragraphs to a None-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

This is a supplementary part of the plant disease detection project found [here](https://abodeza.github.io/projects/gharsa).


## Access Fine-Tuned Model
To access the finetuned model, it can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/abodeza/clip-ViT-B-32-leaf-disease/blob/main/README.md) on Hugging Face.

Or directly used as follows:
```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch

device       = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
clip_model   = SentenceTransformer("abodeza/clip-ViT-B-32-leaf-disease", device=device)
with torch.no_grad():
    text_feats = clip_model.encode(text_prompts, convert_to_tensor=True, device=device)
    text_feats = torch.nn.functional.normalize(text_feats, dim=-1)

    feat       = clip_model.encode([img], convert_to_tensor=True, device=device)
    feat       = torch.nn.functional.normalize(feat, dim=-1)
    sims       = (feat @ text_feats.T).squeeze(0)
```
